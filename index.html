    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm 23 years old and currently finishing up my last semester at the University of New Mexico, where I'm earning a Bachelor of Science in Geography with a minor in Earth and Planetary Science. I've lived in Albuquerque my whole life, and it's where I've grown my passions and interests. In my free time, I enjoy riding motorcycles, diving into Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, playing video games, and watching movies. Whether I'm exploring maps in the real world or fantasy realms, I’ve always been drawn to adventure and discovery.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="section2" class="container-fluid">
    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>I’ve gained a diverse range of experience through roles in both retail and the restaurant industry, each of which has helped me develop strong customer service, communication, and multitasking skills. At Menchies Frozen Yogurt, I provided friendly and knowledgeable service while managing tasks like cleaning, restocking, prepping ingredients, and maintaining the yogurt machines. At Hobby Lobby, I worked as a stockman, where I handled stocking, store maintenance, and customer assistance, often working independently to close the store efficiently. Most recently, I’ve held multiple roles at PF Chang’s, including server assistant, host, expo, and takeout. Each position required strong teamwork and adaptability—whether I was preparing and organizing takeout orders, managing reservations, or supporting servers and guests during busy shifts. These roles have given me a well-rounded understanding of fast-paced, customer-facing environments and the importance of clear communication and reliability.</p>
